# Datesters

## Synopsis

*Datesters* is an online date planner application that allows users to determine the suitability of a dating partner based on their names and returns a **Percent Match**. The application will then suggest a series of popular date spots based on the user's location. Users will be able to save their partners and date spots for future reference.

## Tech Used

* React
* CSS3
* Netlify

## Motivation

We created this project to simplify selecting places to go for date night. Whether your are married, on your first date, or in a committed long-term relationship, picking fun or romantic places to go out and kindle deeper connections is stressful and time-intensive. *Datesters* allows you to quickly get a list of popular date spots based on your location and allows you to save them for future reference.
