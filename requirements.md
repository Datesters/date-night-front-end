# REQUIREMENTS

## Our Software Requirements

### Vision

• What is the vision of this product?

  > The vision of this product is a site where an indecisive user is able to help find date locations and have a fun compatibility rating with their dates name!

• What pain point does this project solve?

  > This solves finding a date location in your area and provides a fun compatibility rating for you and your partner

• Why should we care about your product?

  > There are far too many times people are not able to come to a decision on a place to eat or don't know where to start. This site will help you with that by creating a fun platform where you are able to name your location and add "favorite locations" to your profile! From the user profile you will be able to add, delete or update a location as well as leave a review.

### Scope (In/Out)

  • IN - What will your product do

    > Our product will use an API to display compatibility based on your name and location.
    > You will be able to "heart"/save location and compatibility results.
    > User will be able to add a review to a location
    > User will be able to add, update or delete their review form

  • OUT - What our product will not do

    > Our product will not turn into an IOS or Android app
    > Our product will not match you to singles in the area

### MVP

  • What will your MVP functionality be?

    > We will use 2 APIs, functional front/back-end, Auth0, a login/logout, a way to save locations and compatibility to the user profile, a form to review the locations and update, add or delete reviews.
